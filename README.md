# Machine-Learning
# Diamond Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. It also includes data preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of diamond information, including the following columns:

carat: Weight of the diamond.
cut: Quality of the cut (e.g., "Ideal," "Premium," "Good").
color: Color grade of the diamond (e.g., "D" for colorless to "Z" for light yellow or brown).
clarity: Clarity grade of the diamond (e.g., "IF" for internally flawless to "I3" for included).
dimensions: Length, width, and depth of the diamond.
depth: Total depth percentage.
table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
price: Price of the diamond.
Setup
Ensure you have Python installed. This project is written in Python 3.12.
Install the required libraries by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ancybjohn02/diamond-price-prediction.git
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd diamond-price-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the linear regression model and predict diamond prices.

If using Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook diamond_price_prediction.ipynb
If using Python script:

bash
Copy code
python diamond_price_prediction.py
Methodology
Data loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data preprocessing: Categorical columns (cut, color, clarity) are one-hot encoded.
Feature selection: Features for the linear regression model are chosen.
Model training: A linear regression model is trained on the data.
Model evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated, typically using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Results
The results of the linear regression model will include the coefficients for each feature and the model's performance metrics.
